								Rice is arguably the most important staple food for nearly every Filipino household. However, the cost of rice has continued to steadily rise despite promises to lower grain prices.

							During the 2022 presidential elections, former senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. made the campaign promise to lower the price of rice down to ₱20 per kilo.
							Despite efforts to achieve this ambitious price point, recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority and the Department of Agriculture revealed substantial surges in rice inflation rates.
							The PSA reported a new 14-year high in rice inflation in January 2024, reaching 22.6%, attributed to factors such as high prices in the world market and a low base effect from the previous year. Additionally, the DA noted a 36% spike in retail rice prices in March 2024 compared to the previous year, prompting concerns about food security and discussions on stabilization measures.

						Data

					<div class="flex flex-col pt-12 gap-4">
						<p>
							Our dataset consists of the monthly rice stocks ranging from May 2023 up to March 2024, quarterly local production of rice per region until the end of 2023, monthly imports of rice from May 2023 to February 2024, bimonthly consumer prices of rice per region from May 2023 up to the first phase of April 2024, and suggested daily household budgets & minimum wages per region, taken monthly from May 2023 up to March 2024.
						</p>
						<p>
							We obtained most of our data from OpenSTAT, an open data platform used by the Philippine Statistics Office (PSA) to share data. This is where we gathered the data on monthly rice stocks, regional rice production per quarter, and amounts of rice imported from other countries. We also obtained data on retail prices of three commercially sold types of rice from PSA reports from the first phase of May 2023 up to the first phase of April 2024. Lastly, our values for the suggested daily budget and the nominal minimum wage comes from the IBON Foundation, from their infographics regarding minimum wage versus family living wage per region. The family living wage, the daily cost to maintain a family of five, is used as the suggested daily budget for Filipino households.
						</p>
						<div>
							<p>The preprocessing done on the datasets were the following:</p>
							<ul class="pl-6 list-disc">
								<li>Filtering out empty rows in the Rice Importation sheets.</li>
								<li>Filling in empty values for CARAGA/Region XIII in the Suggested Daily Budget sheet by using the mean of every other region.</li>
								<li>Filling in empty values for June 2023 in the Suggested Daily Budget sheet by using the average between the May and July 2023 data points per region.</li>
								<li>Filling in empty values for June 2023 in the Minimum Wage Income sheet by copying the data from May 2023, since it is expected to change only when there is a wage hike in the region.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>
							We obtained our data from OpenSTAT, an open data platform used by the Philippine Statistics Office (PSA) to share data. We found data on consumer price indexes, retail prices, as well as production and imports for rice in OpenSTAT.
