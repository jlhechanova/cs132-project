							During the 2022 presidential elections, former senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. made the campaign promise to lower the price of rice down to ₱20 per kilo.
							Despite efforts to achieve this ambitious price point, recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority and the Department of Agriculture revealed substantial surges in rice inflation rates.
							The PSA reported a new 14-year high in rice inflation in January 2024, reaching 22.6%, attributed to factors such as high prices in the world market and a low base effect from the previous year. Additionally, the DA noted a 36% spike in retail rice prices in March 2024 compared to the previous year, prompting concerns about food security and discussions on stabilization measures.

						<p>
							Our dataset consists of annual national data on various variables related to rice supply and pricing in the Philippines, spanning from 1995 to 2023. Additionally, we included economic variables from 2012 to 2023 to provide a comprehensive analysis of the affordability of rice.
						</p>
						<p>
							The data on local rice production, rice imports, and rice stocks, measured in thousand metric tons, were obtained from the Philippine Statistics Authority's OpenSTAT platform. Retail prices for different types of rice (Special, Well Milled, and Regular Milled), measured in PHP per kilogram, were also sourced from the PSA's OpenSTAT database. These variables span the years from 1995 to 2023.
						</p>
						<p>
							To analyze the affordability of rice over time, we incorporated data on the suggested daily budget, derived by dividing the monthly food threshold for a family of five by 30, resulting in a daily amount in PHP. This data, along with daily minimum wage income (in PHP per day), was collected from various reports and publications spanning from 2012 to 2023, including sources such as the Official Gazette, Philippine Daily Inquirer, Trading Economics (which sources its data from DOLE), and PSA. Furthermore, we included data on the average daily rice consumption per person, measured in grams, sourced from the PSA's OpenSTAT platform. This data also spans from 2012 to 2023.
						</p>
						<p>
							For preprocessing, we filled in missing values for the suggested daily budget for 2016 using the mean of the values from 2015 and 2017. Similarly, for the average daily rice consumption per person in 2023, we used the mean of the values from 2012 to 2022 to fill in the gaps. These steps ensured that our dataset was complete, enabling us to investigate the correlation and trends between rice supply, consumer prices, and affordability in the Philippines.

							<p class="font-bold">Handling Missing Values</p>
							<p>
								The datasets for the annual data on rice production, rice importation, rice stocks, and rice retail prices were confirmed to have no missing values. However, we found that the suggested daily budget for 2016 was missing, where we decided to use the mean values from 2015 and 2017. Similarly, the average daily rice consumption for 2023 was not available, thus we used the mean of the values from 2012 to 2022 to fill for 2023.
